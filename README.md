# Obsidian GitHub Links
A simple expander for GitHub links in Obsidian. A pasted GitHub issue or PR url will be expanded into a simple `<title><repo>#<number>` format when rendered. 


With this plugin:
<img width="1123" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09f77fbf-e907-4e26-8109-e9716898ac6a">

Without this plugin:
<img width="1042" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cb62ced-b02c-4346-b6e8-4b09908c829f">


NOTE this is implemented as a markdown post-processor which means the link expansion only takes place in [reading mode](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Edit+and+preview+Markdown#Editor+views). This works well with the Kanban plugin: https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban as the cards are rendered in reading mode.
